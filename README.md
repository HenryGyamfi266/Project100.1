# Project Overview

## Efficient Data Sorting and Performance Benchmarking with Bubble Sort
This project is about implementing a command-line program that generates two lists of random integers, sorts them using the bubble sort algorithm, and reports the time taken for each sort operation. 
The program accepts two integers as input via command-line arguments to define the range for generating random numbers. The sorting performance of each list is measured and displayed, 
allowing users to see the impact of the sorting algorithm on the time taken to arrange the data.
